# Maximization Notes

## Maximizing the area of a rectangle or square

Quadratic equations can be used to convert a perimeter into area.  The example is a farmer wants to make a fence.  He has purchased 80 feet of fencing.  He wants to fence in 3 sides and the 4th side is his barn.  

## Upside down parabola
Since the max is what needs to be found, a upside down parabola is the solution to the problem.

## Frist equation needed is the perimeter of a rectangle.

![\Large P=L+W+L+W](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;P=L+W+L+W)

Since we only need three sides to fence in the field the equation is 

![\Large P=L+W+L](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;P=L+W+L)

![\Large P=2L+W](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;P=2L+W)

Since we are working with quadratics, the variables, L and W have to be simplified to just L or W.  We have to put 80 in for P, Equation to do this is

![\Large 80=2L+W](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;80=2L+W)

![\Large 80-2L=W](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;80-2L=W)

Finding the maximum area can now be done using our variables for length and width expressed in terms of legnth.  

![\Large Area = L(-2L+80)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;Area=L(-2L+80L))


![\Large Area = -2L^2+80](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;Area=-2L^2+80L)

![\Large Area=-\frac{b}{2a}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;Area=-\frac{b}{2a})

![\Large x=-\frac{80}{2(-2)}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;x=-\frac{80}{2(-2)})

![\Large x=-\frac{80}{-4}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;x=-\frac{80}{-4})

$$Line of Symetry = 20$$
The line of symetry is the x value if you want to graph the function and also the maximum length of one L.  Then we go back to our perimeter formula and we see the legnth of each side.
$$Perimeter = 2L+W$$
$$ Perimeter = 2(20)+20+20$$
